            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>I'm a Staff Software Engineer with a unique background in data and ML infrastructure, trust and safety, medical records, customer support, and forensic accounting. I specialise in spotting patterns across diverse domains and building strategic platforms that drive long-term leverage.
            <p>I’ve worked in both London and Silicon Valley, and I bring a systems mindset shaped by the best of both worlds — balancing strategic platform thinking with pragmatic execution, and always with an eye on long-term maintainability.</p>
            <p>My approach is characterised by thoughtful problem identification, user-centered design in the backend space, and a focus on long-term impact over immediate output. I care deeply about how developer experience accelerates impact.</p>

                <li><strong>Surface-level productivity</strong> - I thrive in environments that prioritize strategic problem-solving over short-term activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Constant urgency</strong> - I do my best work when I have time to think strategically, align with long-term goals, and focus on lasting improvements.</li>
                <li><strong>Rushed feature delivery</strong> - I prefer environments where success isn't just measured by how quickly features are delivered, but by the value created for users and the long-term impact of our work.</li>
                <li><strong>Rigid roles</strong> - I excel when I can adapt and shape my responsibilities to drive meaningful outcomes, rather than being confined to narrowly defined tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Top-down decision making</strong> - I perform best in environments that value psychological safety, where teams solve problems together and individuals are empowered to contribute meaningfully.</li>
                <li><strong>Low-level optimisation</strong> - I care more about accelerating developers than CPUs, despite having strong C++ skills. Turning days of work into minutes is more satisfying to me than shaving milliseconds off code execution.</li>
